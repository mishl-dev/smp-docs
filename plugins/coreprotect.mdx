Block logging and rollback protection. While primarily an admin tool, it helps protect your builds and track changes.

## What It Does

CoreProtect logs all block changes, chest interactions, and player actions. This means if something happens to your build, staff can investigate and restore it.

<Info>
  All block changes, container transactions, and player actions are logged automatically.
</Info>

### What's Protected

- All block placements and breaks
- Container transactions (chests, barrels, etc.)
- Entity interactions
- Player actions

### Need Help?

If something happens to your build:
1. Don't panic - everything is logged
2. Contact staff with the location and approximate time
3. Staff can investigate and rollback griefing if needed

<Note>
  Contact staff if you need help with rollbacks. They can restore damaged builds!
