Disables Mojang's chat reporting system on the server.

## Privacy Protection

This plugin prevents chat messages from being reported to Mojang, keeping moderation within our server community.

<Info>
  Your chat messages stay within our server - they are not sent to Mojang.
</Info>

### How It Works

- Chat messages stay within our server
- Server staff handle all moderation
- Messages are not reportable to Mojang
- Our community, our rules

<Warning>
  You still need to follow server rules! Staff moderation is active.
</Warning>
