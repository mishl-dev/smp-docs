description: A complete guide to managing your team and protecting your base
---

BetterTeams allows you to form alliances, share resources, and protect your belongings with friends.

## Quick Start

Creating a team is the first step to collaborating on the server.

1. **Create your team:** `/team create <name>`
2. **Invite your friends:** `/team invite <player>`
3. **Accepting an invitation:** Players can join using `/team join <team>`

:::tip
By default, teams are private. Use `/team open` if you want anyone to be able to join without an invite!

## Protecting Your Base

BetterTeams provides several ways to keep your items safe and accessible to your team.

### Team Home
You can set one central location for your team to regroup.
- **Set your home:** Stand at your base and use `/team sethome`.
- **Go home:** Use `/team home` from anywhere.

### Chest Claims
Stop others from stealing your loot by claiming your storage.
- **Claim a chest:** Look at a chest and type `/team chest claim`. Only team members will be able to open it.
- **Share everything:** Team members automatically share access to all claimed chests.

### Shared Storage
If you need a mobile shared inventory, use `/team echest`. This opens a shared Ender Chest that all team members can access from anywhere.

## Team Features

### Communication
Stay in touch without letting the whole server hear you.
- **Team Chat:** Use `/team chat <message>` to talk only to your team.
- **Allies:** You can also use `/team allychat` to talk to allied teams.

### Management & Ranks
- **Ranks:** Use `/team promote <player>` or `/team demote <player>` to manage who can change settings or kick members.
- **Customization:** Stand out with `/team tag <tag>` and `/team color <color>`.
- **PvP:** Toggle friendly fire with `/team pvp`.
