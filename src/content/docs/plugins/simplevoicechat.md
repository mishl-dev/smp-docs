## Installation

**Client:** Install the Simple Voice Chat mod on your client (Fabric, Forge, NeoForge, or Quilt).

**Server:** The plugin is installed on the server, but you still need the mod on your client to use voice features.

## Key Bindings

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `V` (default) | Push-to-talk |
| `Alt` + `V` | Mute/unmute microphone |

You can change these in Minecraft's controls settings under "Voice Chat".

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/voicechat help` | Show all available commands |
| `/voicechat invite <player>` | Invite a player to your voice group |
| `/voicechat join <group>` | Join a voice group |
| `/voicechat leave` | Leave your current voice group |

## How It Works

- **Proximity Chat:** You can only hear players within a certain distance
- **Groups:** Create voice groups to talk with specific players anywhere
- **Mute Toggle:** Press the mute key to quickly silence your microphone

:::tip
Install the mod on your client even if you don't want to talk - you'll still be able to hear others!
:::

## Troubleshooting

- Make sure the mod is installed on both client and server
- Check your microphone permissions in system settings
- Adjust distance and volume in the voice chat settings (mod menu)
