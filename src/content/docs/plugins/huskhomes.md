HuskHomes is the primary way to navigate the world. It allows you to save locations and teleport instantly.

## Your Homes

You can save multiple locations to return to later. Each home requires a unique name.

- **Set a home:** Stand at the location and use `/sethome <name>`.
- **Teleport back:** Use `/home <name>` to return to any of your saved spots.
- **List homes:** Type `/homes` to see all your saved locations.
- **Remove a home:** Use `/delhome <name>` if you no longer need it.

:::tip
Always set a home at your base before heading out on an adventure!

## Teleporting to Friends

If you want to meet up with another player, you can send a teleport request.

1. **Ask to go to them:** Use `/tpa <player>`. They must accept for you to teleport.
2. **Bring them to you:** Use `/tpahere <player>` to invite someone to your current location.
3. **Accepting/Denying:** If someone sends you a request, use `/tpaccept` or `/tpdeny`.

## Public Locations

Admins often set up public warps for important landmarks like Spawn or the Shopping District.

- **Visit a warp:** Use `/warp <name>`.
- **See all warps:** Type `/warps` to see a list of every public destination.
