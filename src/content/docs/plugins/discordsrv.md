description: A guide on how to link your Discord account to play on the server
---

To ensure a safe and connected community, you must link your Discord account before you can join the Minecraft server.

To join the server, you must follow this 3-step process: **Join** (to get a code), **Link** (on Discord), and **Rejoin**.

### 1. Get Your Code
First, try to join the Minecraft server at `mc.mishl.dev`. Since you aren't linked yet, you will be automatically kicked and shown a 4-digit code.

### 2. Link on Discord
Once you have your code, head over to our Discord and find the bot to link your account.

1. **Join our Discord:** If you haven't already, join the official [Infinity SMP Discord](https://discord.gg/RuX7USZ5xF).
2. **Find the Bot:** Look for **Infinity SMP#4430** in the member list or DM list.

3. **Message the Code:** Send a Direct Message (DM) to the bot containing **only** the 4-digit code you got from the kick screen.

### 3. Rejoin and Play
Once the bot confirms your account is linked, you can now join the Minecraft server! Your rank and roles will sync automatically.

The code is unique to you and expires after a short period. If your code stops working, simply try to join the server again to get a new one.

## Benefits of Linking
- **Sync Ranks:** Your Discord roles and Minecraft ranks stay in sync.
- **Cross-Chat:** Talk to players in-game directly from Discord.
