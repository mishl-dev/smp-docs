Disables Mojang's chat reporting system on the server.

## Privacy Protection

This plugin prevents chat messages from being reported to Mojang, keeping moderation within our server community.

:::note
Your chat messages stay within our server - they are not sent to Mojang.

### How It Works

- Chat messages stay within our server
- Server staff handle all moderation
- Messages are not reportable to Mojang
- Our community, our rules

:::caution
You still need to follow server rules! Staff moderation is active.
